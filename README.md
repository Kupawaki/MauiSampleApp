# MauiSampleApp

This is just a simple app which serves as my introduction to the .NET MAUI environment. 

This apps only current functionality is to display an alert which gives the user either a positive or negative choice, and then a label below the button displays what it was that was chosen. Simple, but an effective introduction to MAUI.

As usual, youtube was very helpful in my goal of gaining a simple understanding of MAUI. This video in particular was the best I found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rumfIg9qJ_Y

### Lessons Learned
The only major lesson I learned this week is that .NET 6.0, despite it being listed as LTS, is not actually in Long Term Support. Support for Android, Mac, and IOS platforms is being phased out in 6.0. Use .NET 7.0
