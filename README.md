# MauiSampleApp

This is just a simple app which serves as my introduction to the .NET MAUI environment. 

This apps only current functionality is to display an alert which gives the user either a positive or negative choice, and then a label below the button displays what it was that was chosen. Simple, but an effective introduction to MAUI.

As usual, youtube was very helpful in my goal of gaining a simple understanding of MAUI. This video in particular was the best I found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rumfIg9qJ_Y
